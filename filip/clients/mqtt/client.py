class MQTTClient(mqtt.Client):
    """
    This class is an extension to the MQTT client from the well established
    Eclipse Pahoâ„¢ MQTT Python Client. The official documentation is located
    here: https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python

    The class adds additional functions to facilitate the communication to
    FIWARE's IoT-Agent via MQTT. It magically generates and subscribes to all
    important topics that are necessary to establish a
    bi-directional communication with the IoT-Agent.

    Note:
        The client does not sync the device configuration with the IoT-Agent.
        This is up to the user!

    Note:
        The extension does not effect the normal workflow or any other
        functionality known from the original client.

        The client does not yet support the retrieval of command
        configurations via mqtt documented here:
        https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#api-overview

    Example:
        This example shows the basic usage of the client. It does not
        demonstrate its whole capabilities. Please check the single methods
        for more details. Please also keep in mind that this still requires
        provisioning of the device in the IoT-Agent and sending the commands
        via the context broker. For more details check the additional example
        section::

        Args:
            client_id:
                Unique client id string used when connecting
                to the broker. If client_id is zero length or None, then the
                behaviour is defined by which protocol version is in use. If
                using MQTT v3.1.1, then a zero length client id will be sent
                to the broker and the broker will generate a random for the
                client. If using MQTT v3.1 then an id will be randomly
                generated. In both cases, clean_session must be True.
                If this is not the case a ValueError will be raised.
            clean_session:
                boolean that determines the client type. If True,
                the broker will remove all information about this client when it
                disconnects. If False, the client is a persistent client and
                subscription information and queued messages will be retained
                when the client disconnects.
                Note that a client will never discard its own outgoing
                messages on disconnect. Calling connect() or reconnect() will
                cause the messages to be resent.  Use reinitialise() to reset
                a client to its original state. The clean_session argument
                only applies to MQTT versions v3.1.1 and v3.1. It is not
                accepted if the MQTT version is v5.0 - use the clean_start
                argument on connect() instead.
            userdata:
                defined data of any type that is passed as the "userdata"
                parameter to callbacks. It may be updated at a later point
                with the user_data_set() function.
            protocol:
                explicit setting of the MQTT version to use for this client.
                Can be paho.mqtt.client.MQTTv311 (v3.1.1),
                paho.mqtt.client.MQTTv31 (v3.1) or paho.mqtt.client.MQTTv5
                (v5.0), with the default being v3.1.1.
            transport:
                Set to "websockets" to use WebSockets as the transport
                mechanism. Set to "tcp" to use raw TCP, which is the default.
            devices:
                List of device configurations that will be registered
                with the client. Consequently, the client will be able to
                subscribe to all registered device topics. Furthermore,
                after registration messages can simply published by the
                devices id.
            service_groups:
                List of service group configurations that will be registered
                with the client. These should be known upon subscribing
                because the client will check for a matching service group if
                this is not known or registered with the IoT-Agent service
                the receiving of commands will fail. Please check the
                official documentation of the IoT-Agents API for more details.
            encoder:
                Encoder class that will automatically parse the supported
                payload formats to a dictionary and vice versa. This
                essentially saves boiler plate code.
